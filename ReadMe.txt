Yearly Stock Trends

This code sorts through daily stock data over a year and outputs yearly change, yearly % change,
and total volume per ticker in the dataset.

Additionally, it finds the ticker with the highest total volume, highest % increase,
and hightest % decrease. 

Finally, adds formatting to the yearly change cell to color positive changes as green and negative
changes as red.

Included screenshots of my results for all sheets in the workbook.
